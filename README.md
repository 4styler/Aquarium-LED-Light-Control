# Aquarium-LED-Light-Control

Under Construction. Code is not commented. Use Pin 22 for WS2812 LEDs and Pin 10 for PWM control for white LEDs.
ESP32 trys to get WPS on start.
You need Several Librarys for it. It is commented in the first lines. 
I hope you like it. WS2812 seems to dont need a level Shift on Pin 22.
